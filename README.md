## How to install
### Requirements
You will need VirtualBox, vagrant and ansible to be installed. ansible also requires Python and some Python modules to be installed.

Fast way to install VirtualBox and vagrant is to use brew cask. ansible can be installed with homebrew as well:

```
# brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
brew install ansible
```


### Start VM
Go to the railsbox directory and type `vagrant up`. vagrant will download the base box and provision it with ansible using your configuration.

```
cd /path/to/rails/project/railsbox/development
vagrant up
```

Once it's done, you'll be able to login into it using `vagrant ssh` command. Your application is stored in /{app_name} directory.
